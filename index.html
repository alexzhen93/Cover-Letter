      <p>Dear Apple Orchard:</p>
      <p>
        This letter is to express my interest in the Orchard Web Developer
        Program. I would love to be part of this yearlong program with the
        Orchard, where I can contribute to technologies to simplify life for
        people and teams. I also appreciate that Apple offers opportunities for
        people to work right in the middle of Appleâ€™s creative process, work on
        real projects, and meet real deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of 2021, I started my first career experience as a Web
        Application Developer for the Radar team. It was a 5-month long program
        where I collaborated with engineers to create an internal Angular
        application that provided key stakeholders insights and meaning from
        data within the AMP organization (Apple Media Products). Throughout my
        time on the career experience, the technologies that were used for the
        project included Angular, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Tidbits, and
        Node.JS/ETL. I was always looking for ways to expand my knowledge as a
        developer. For example, I helped develop an end-to-end automated
        reporting pipeline that extracts data from thousands of projects to get
        a higher level of insight. I also implemented an API in the reporting
        pipeline to read from 1880 components to help identify areas of focus to
        improve access control within the organization. As I reflected on what I
        enjoyed the most, I realized I wanted to improve efficiency by building
        new tools and utilizing advanced technologies, which prompted me to
        pursue a software engineer career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Orchard Program, I hope to learn a lot more about the software
        engineering life cycle as a whole and be able to code more efficiently
        with the help of a mentor. Eventually, I want to be able to contribute
        to impactful technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reviewing my application, I hope you will agree that I am a
        competent candidate who is eager to learn and contribute to the best of
        my abilities. Please let me know if I can provide you with any
        additional information. Thank you for your time and consideration!
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Alex Zhen Zheng</p>
